# Register-Login-API
To create a registration and login system in Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB:

Setup: Initialize a Node.js project and install dependencies like express, mongoose (for MongoDB), bcrypt (for password hashing), and express-session (for session handling).

Database: Use MongoDB to store user data. Define a User model with fields for username, email, and password, ensuring passwords are hashed with bcrypt for security.

Registration Route: Create a route to handle user registration, where new users' data is validated, hashed, and saved to MongoDB.

Login Route: Set up a login route where users enter their credentials. The password is compared with the hashed version in the database, and a session is created upon successful login.

Session Management: Use sessions to keep users logged in. Store the session ID in cookies, allowing users to access protected routes without re-logging in each time.
